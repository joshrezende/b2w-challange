# B2W Challenge

### Mission

Develop a Twitter's clone timeline following the image attached. Your solution must be responsive ([RWD](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) and [MF](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933)) and work in IE9+.

##### Level 1

Use the Twitter api to create your timeline.

##### Level 2

A plus is to call the Flickr api and get the first image based on the #hashtag you may find in a tweet and improve your timeline with images :).

### Hint 

You may use our tests accounts to authorize your requests. 

The Base64 encoded bearer token credential for Twitter api is ```bWVjaTllbUI3MjA1Ymo0VzQ0eFFDQVRVNjowR0RKWWFUeDg1bkRwbm9pOHp3R2EwVDdNU1FJT1J0OVJkS3Y2aEFmRFNSb0QzUjRGUA==```.

The apiKey for Flickr api is ```3de470a3de4c9510ec040b59100b4cf2```.
